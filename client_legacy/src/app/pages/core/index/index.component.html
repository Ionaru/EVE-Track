    <p>
      EVE Track can be best described as an <strong>EVE Online API viewer</strong>, it enables you to view your EVE
      Online character information
      without having to log into the game.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      My goal is to provide you with a simple-to-use API viewer while still providing a lot of information about your
      character(s).
