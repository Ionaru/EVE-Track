          In this approach, rather than putting the pre-bootstrap content inside
          the <app-root> component content, we're leaving it external to the Angular 2
          application entirely. This way, the content is not automatically removed when
          the root component template is rendered. Instead, we'll leave this overlay in
          place until the "appready" event bubbles up to the document, at which point,
          we can gracefully fade it out of view.
