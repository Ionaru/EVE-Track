  Choose scopes
</h1>
<p>To display your data from EVE Online, EVIE requires your permission to use your 'scopes'.</p>
<br>
<h3>What is a scope?</h3>
<p>A scope is a certain set of data that a third-party application, like EVIE, can access from your character.</p>
<p>For example you can grant access to view your skill queue, but not your wallet balance.</p>

<form>
    <label>
        <input type="checkbox">
        Boo
    </label>

    <p>You will be able to review your chosen scopes after logging in.</p>
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary add-character-button" (click)="authCharacter()">
