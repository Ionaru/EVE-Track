        <h1>Welcome to EVIE!</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            EVIE can be best described as an <strong>EVE Online API viewer</strong>, it enables you to view your
            EVE Online character information without having to log into the game.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My goal is to provide you with a simple-to-use API viewer that gives you as much useful information about
            your characters as possible.
        </p>

            This website uses SSO login from EVE Online.
            This will also enable you to save multiple characters and quickly access their data.
