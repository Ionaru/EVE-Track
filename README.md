# EVIE

EVIE is a web-based API interface for EVE Online. It’s built using modern web technologies to provide a fast and responsive interface while still displaying a large amount of information.

My goal of this project is to build a robust API interface that is usable on any platform: including both desktop and mobile. *cough* cross-platform app *cough*. I don’t just want to display data from the API, but also do calculations, predictions and more to make EVIE more useful, even when you also have the game open.

Right now the features are limited, but new pages are being built and I have a lot of exciting features planned!
